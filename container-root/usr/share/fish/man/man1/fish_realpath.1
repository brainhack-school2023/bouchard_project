.SS "Description"
This is an implementation of the external realpath command that doesn't support any options\&. It's meant to be used only by scripts which need to be portable\&. In general scripts shouldn't invoke this directly\&. They should just use \fCrealpath\fP which will fallback to this builtin if an external command cannot be found\&.
.PP
If the path is invalid no translated path will be written to stdout and an error will be reported\&. This implementation behaves like the GNU command being invoked with \fC--canonicalize-existing\fP\&.
