\fBcd\fP [DIRECTORY]
.fi
.PP
.SS "Description"
\fCcd\fP changes the current working directory\&.
.PP
If \fCDIRECTORY\fP is supplied, it will become the new directory\&. If no parameter is given, the contents of the \fCHOME\fP environment variable will be used\&.
.PP
If \fCDIRECTORY\fP is a relative path, the paths found in the \fCCDPATH\fP environment variable array will be tried as prefixes for the specified path\&.
.PP
Note that the shell will attempt to change directory without requiring \fCcd\fP if the name of a directory is provided (starting with \fC\&.\fP, \fC/\fP or \fC~\fP, or ending with \fC/\fP)\&.
.PP
Fish also ships a wrapper function around the builtin \fCcd\fP that understands \fCcd -\fP as changing to the previous directory\&. See also \fC\fCprevd\fP\fP\&. This wrapper function maintains a history of the 25 most recently visited directories in the \fC$dirprev\fP and \fC$dirnext\fP global variables\&.
